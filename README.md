This repository is where the supervision tracking templates and forms are developed. Since these are housed on iAuditor software, and that software is proprietary to SafetyCulture (not TrainABA), there is not much to house here on our own. We suggest that users who wish to share templates will upload their templates to the iAuditor Public Library. That is how TrainABA uploaded the templates.

History: As of 2015, TrainABA tracking templates lived on iAuditor, for the reasons below:

Designed for field assessments in safety and healthcare
High security
Free to use & download
Shared PDFs easily
Highly customizable templates (TrainABA makes started templates for you to use/modify/share)
Worked with mobile and desktop

Company had a profit model for sustainability

Easy to use

Contained same feature set we outlined in our prototype

Around the same time we had a development team building TRACK software for ABA supervision, another ABA organization was first to market with a similar software. Although TrainABA software was designed to be lighter/more mobile, the first-to-market intranet-based software was already done. TrainABA pulled the project, opting for TRACK templates on iAuditor. 

Ultimately, the decision was made not to pursue TRACK software development. It was expensive to pay freelance developers and the results were mixed. The TrainABA team dissolved in the course of the next two years. Theisen, the founder, stayed with TrainABA. If you find these materials useful, please contribute because this job is harder for one person than it appears.
